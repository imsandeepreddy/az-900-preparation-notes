# Networking Basics - Summary ‚ö°Ô∏èüåê

A quick reference guide summarizing essential networking concepts from Linux Journey.

### 1. Network Basics

* **ISP:** Internet Service Provider delivering internet.
* **Router:** Connects devices to the internet via Ethernet or WiFi.
* **WAN:** Network between router and the broader internet.
* **WLAN:** Wireless devices connected to the router.
* **LAN:** Wired devices connected to the router.
* **Hosts:** Devices on the network.
* **Packets:** Units of data transmitted across the network.

### 2. OSI Model

* A theoretical 7-layer networking model.
* Helps understand how data travels through networks.
* TCP/IP model is based on concepts from OSI.

---

### 3. TCP/IP Model

* Practical model powering the Internet.
* Layers:

  * **Application:** Interfaces programs with network (HTTP, SMTP).
  * **Transport:** Manages data transfer, integrity, ports (TCP, UDP).
  * **Network:** Routes packets between hosts (IP, ICMP).
  * **Link:** Handles physical transmission (Ethernet, fiber).

### 4. Network Addressing

* **MAC Address:** Unique, hardware-based identifier for network adapters.
* **IP Address:** Software-based identifier for devices, varies (IPv4/IPv6).
* **Hostnames:** Human-readable names mapped to IP addresses.

### 5. Application Layer

* Data (e.g., email) is prepared and sent through application protocols like SMTP.
* Application layer passes data to transport layer via specified ports.

---

### 6. Transport Layer

* Breaks data into **segments**.
* Uses **ports** to direct data to specific services.
* Protocols:

  * **UDP:** Unreliable but faster, used for streaming.
  * **TCP:** Reliable, connection-oriented; uses 3-way handshake (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK).

---

### 7. Network Layer

* Routes packets between devices across networks and subnets.
* Encapsulates segments into packets with source/destination IPs.
* Passes packets to the Link layer for physical transmission.

---

### 8. Link Layer

* Encapsulates packets into **frames** with source/destination MAC addresses.
* Uses **ARP** to map IP addresses to MAC addresses within the same network.
* Frames are sent over the physical network and received frames are de-encapsulated layer-by-layer until data reaches the application.

---

### 9. DHCP Overview

* **DHCP** assigns IP addresses dynamically to devices.
* Prevents manual IP conflicts.
* Commonly handled by the router in home networks.
* DHCP message exchange:

  1. **DISCOVER** - Client searches for DHCP server.
  2. **OFFER** - Server offers IP info.
  3. **REQUEST** - Client accepts offer.
  4. **ACK** - Server confirms assignment.
